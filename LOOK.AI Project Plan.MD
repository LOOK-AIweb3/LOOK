1. Project Overview
1.1 Project Background
Since its launch in 2020, Solana has redefined blockchain performance with its Proof of History (PoH) and Tower BFT consensus mechanisms, processing up to 65,000 transactions per second at $0.00025 per transaction (Solana Labs, 2020). By 2025, Solana’s TVL exceeds $50 billion, spanning DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and community-driven meme tokens (DefiLlama, 2025). EVM-compatible blockchains, including Ethereum ($150 billion TVL), Polygon (10,000+ dApps), and BNB Chain (low-cost DeFi), dominate smart contract ecosystems (CoinMarketCap, 2025). Meanwhile, Cosmos enables cross-chain interoperability, Polkadot supports multi-chain architectures, Avalanche powers high-performance subnets, and emerging chains like Aptos and Sui contribute to a diverse ecosystem with over 8 million daily active users and 100% annual transaction growth (DappRadar, 2025).
Token issuance platforms have fueled this expansion. Solana’s pump.fun democratizes token creation with minimal costs, driving thousands of launches and millions in daily trading volume (pump.fun, 2025). EVM-based Uniswap and PancakeSwap leverage automated market makers (AMMs) for rapid token deployment, while Cosmos’ Osmosis, Polkadot’s Kusama, and Avalanche’s Trader Joe support cross-chain and innovative tokens.
